# Finding Kaggle Dataset and enriching with scraping.
The aim of this project is to find and enrich a dataset that we must select from different sources. I have decided to use the following dataset ["New York City Airbnb Open Data"](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data) because is a information IÂ´m familiar with, it is a clean dataset with high level of usability and  I can find articles and webs in order to enrich it.

To achive all this I will follow nexts steps:
>1. **Expore Kaggle Databese**. And find the one that I will foccus on.
>2. **Find usefull information to enrich my data conclusions** 
>2. **Think on a wire conductor**  What do we whant to support whith our info ?
>3. **Clean the dataset and the scraping info**. which are the usefull datas to find and support my hypothesis?
>4. **Analyze the data**. 
>5. **Make it visual**. For me and for others to de understable

### Exproring datasets and finding enriching information.


### Wire conductor 
Air BandB in NY by neighbourhoods, are there relation between the number of bookings per neighbourhoods and the amount of monuments in those zones? I will focuss my attention in those years over 2015, in order to skip the years involved in the Great recesion.

### Cleaning and enriching
I have follow 3 steps in order to clean and found the important imformation:
>1. Look for the years over 2015
>2. Import and clean scraping information and give it a shape similar to our dataframe table.
>3. Cross both information in order to relate ir.

### Visualization and conclusions

### Aditional information

I have use severals libraries in order to be able to analyze and me dada visual, suchs as: numpy, pandas, regex, seaborn, src.clean_utils and matplotlib.
